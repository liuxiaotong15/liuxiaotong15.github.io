I completed my undergraduate and master's degrees at the University of Science and Technology Beijing (USTB) in 2009 and 2012, respectively, and earned my Ph.D. from the University of Chinese Academy of Sciences (UCAS) in 2021. In January 2023, I was appointed as an Associate Professor at BISTU. I am also a member of Beijing Advanced Innovation Center for Materials Genome Engineering, BISTU. From February 2023 to February 2024, I served as a <a href='https://liuxiaotong15.github.io/assets/pdf/csc_cert.pdf'>visiting scholar</a> at Université catholique de Louvain (UCLouvain) in Belgium for one year (<a href='https://liuxiaotong15.github.io/assets/pdf/csc_intro.pdf'>funded by CSC/WBI/FNRS Scholarship, five individuals from China each year</a>). My academic journey was shaped by the guidance of two mentors, <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=gg8veA8AAAAJ&hl=zh-CN'>Prof. Hailei Zhao</a> and <a href='https://people.ucas.ac.cn/~0035646'>Prof. Xiaodong Wen</a>, along with a "virtual mentor" from UCLouvain, <a href='https://perso.uclouvain.be/gian-marco.rignanese/index.html'>Prof. Gian-Marco Rignanese</a>. Inspired by their footsteps, my current research primarily focuses on machine learning and theoretical computation within the field of materials science, often referred to by the trendy term "AI4Science".

"All models are wrong, but some are useful", as the saying goes. Different computational methods exhibit varying errors when calculating the same physical quantities; these discrepancies vary by material and computational approach. A key aspect of my research involves leveraging these error patterns in multi-fidelity data-driven models to more accurately predict the physical properties of actual materials. Another primary area of my focus is generative AI. I am currently endeavoring to develop improved descriptors and harness techniques like Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) and Large Language Model (LLM)-based generative models to guide material design. The descriptors I design are tested in the Matbench to evaluate their performance. Along these research trajectories, I encounter intriguing minor problems, which I abstract into challenges suitable for master's and undergraduate students, offering a collaborative exploration of the field.

In addition to my academic pursuits, I have diverse professional experience having worked with a self-driving startup (<a href='https://www.uisee.com/'>UISEE</a>), an internet company (<a href='https://www.renren.com/'>Renren</a>), and a large state-owned enterprise (<a href='http://www.petrochina.com.cn/'>PetroChina</a>). These roles have broadened my perspective on problem-solving. I frequently share these experiences with my students and, if they show interest, I am open to collaborating with them on related projects. For instance, I collaborated with some students to develop a website for researchers, <a href='http://reaction.center'> http://reaction.center/ </a>.
