abstract = {The Na+ superionic conductor (NASICON)-type Na4MnV(PO4)3 (NMVP) has been considered as one of the most promising cathode materials for sodium-ion batteries because of its higher operating voltage and low cost compared to Na3V2(PO4)3. However, the Jahn-Teller effect of Mn3+ during (de)sodiation processes and the sluggish electrode reaction kinetics strongly restrict its cycling stability and rate-capability. Herein, polyanion lattice engineering is developed by SiO44− substitution on PO43− to strengthen the adjacent local environment of the active coordination octahedron and improve the structural stability. The relieved lattice local distortions induce an enhanced Na+ diffusion simultaneously. Moreover, the SiO44− substitution leads to an improved intrinsic electronic conductivity. With these synergetic effects, the as-synthesized Na4MnV(PO4)2.9(SiO4)0.1/C composite delivers a reversible specific capacity of 98.7 mAh g−1 at 0.5C and an excellent cycle stability, with 91.4\% capacity retention after 200 cycles at 0.5C and 76.4\% capacity retention after 1000 cycles under a high rate of 5C. Besides, significantly improved rate performance of a capacity retention (C10C/C0.5C) at 10C (77.4\%) that far exceeds that of the pristine Na4MnV(PO4)3/C electrode (45.3\%) is realized. This structural regulation strategy offers new insights for developing high-performance Mn-based polyanionic cathodes with superior cycling stability.}

abstract = {Crystalline solids, especially ion conductors, often exhibit site-occupancy disorder, including partial occupation of the mobile ion sublattice or mixed occupation of the framework sublattice. The key to predicting physical properties, such as ionic transport barrier, lies in identifying appropriate configurations that can reflect the local features of site-occupancy disorder. However, as supercell size and compositional complexity increase, existing configuration search methods suffer from low search efficiency and insufficient universality. Here, we propose a multi-strategy configuration search method called MCTSGT, where the search space is represented as a tree structure using Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) and equivalent nodes are dynamically pruned using the distance matrix of graph theory (GT) to improve search efficiency. Two alternative search strategies, Warren-Cowley short-range order parameters and configurational ground-state energy, are provided to enhance the adaptability of MCTSGT for different systems. Applied to nine typical disordered structures, MCTSGT achieves a maximum search efficiency improvement of 14% compared to Monte Carlo simulated annealing. Furthermore, energy barriers of obtained configurations via the bond valence site energy (BVSE) method exhibit a consistent trend with experimental studies. Our work provides important insights into machine-learning modeling of disordered structures and contributes to materials discovery across a broader compositional space.}

To validate the algorithms, we examine three widely-used learning methods relevant to multi-fidelity data through the design of multi-fidelity datasets that encompass various types of noise. As we expected, employing multi-fidelity data learning methods yields better results compared to solely using high-fidelity data learning methods. Additionally, considering the inherent various types of noise within datasets, the comprehensive correction strategy proves to be the most effective. Moreover, multi-fidelity learning methods facilitate effective decision-making processes by enabling the combination of datasets from various sources. They extract knowledge from lower fidelity data, improving model accuracy compared to models solely relying on high-fidelity data.},

abstract = {As an excellent energy storage technology, liquid metal batteries (LMBs) have gained significant attention recently. For these batteries, because lithium is commonly used as the anode, the specific energy capacity and charge–discharge performance mainly depend on the cathode. Therefore, the selection of the cathode material is extremely important. Designing this material involves finding an optimal combination of elements. Despite limited data, machine learning techniques can still be employed to conduct meaningful research. In this work, we developed a new evaluation method that not only focuses on energy density, which has been the primary focus in previous studies, but also considers rate performance of the battery system. The entire workflow of the method includes regression with different models, numerical differentiation, correlation coefficient calculation, and variance inflation factor evaluation. Based on the elements in our current dataset (including Te, Se, Sb, Cu, Zn, Bi, Sn and Pb), the importance degree sequences of these elements in terms of energy density and rate capability are delivered. Considering the overall performance, we suggest that Te and Se are particularly promising candidates for cathode materials. Finally, we discuss the quantitative results in the context of conventional qualitative understanding in electrochemistry, and we find that they are consistent and without contradiction. We have open-sourced the curated dataset and all relevant codes and we believe that as more research is conducted and data are accumulated, expanding the dataset to include more elements will yield even more promising results.},

On both composition and structure benchmarks, it reaches the performance of the composition-only reference model CrabNet and surpasses it on several tasks. For structure benchmarks, we compare crystallographic information files (CIFs) with natural language (NL) descriptions, and for composition benchmarks, we compare raw chemical formulas with NL; overall, NL input lowers the mean absolute error (MAE) by 40.3% relative to CIFs or formulas. Across datasets of 100–100,000 samples, AlchemBERT frequently outperforms structure-based and knowledge-driven baselines. These results show that compact LLMs coupled with flexible NL encodings can unify composition and structure reasoning, providing a practical template for accelerating data-driven materials discovery.},

title={AlchemBERT: Exploring Lightweight Language Models for Materials Informatics},
preview={BERT.png},
abstract={The emergence of large language models (LLMs) has spurred numerous applications across various domains, including material design. In this field, an increasing number of generative models focus on directly generating materials with desired properties more accurately, moving away from the traditional approach of enumerating vast numbers of candidates and relying on computationally intensive screening algorithms. However, we assert that without accurate prediction capabilities, effective material design is unattainable, as generating necessary structures becomes futile if their quality cannot be reliably evaluated. Matbench provides an excellent foundation for predictive tasks, yet prior efforts with LLMs have primarily focused on composition-related tasks using models such as GPT or LLaMA. In this study, we revisit BERT, a relatively small LLM with 110 million parameters, which is significantly smaller than GPT or LLaMA models containing billions of parameters. Remarkably, we demonstrate that BERT-base achieves comparable performance to these larger models in material property prediction tasks. Extending beyond composition tasks, we introduce BERT’s application in structure prediction using CIF (Crystallographic Information File) data and natural language descriptions of structures. Our results rival state-of-the-art composition models such as CrabNet and, in several tasks across datasets ranging from a few hundred to over a hundred thousand samples, even surpass traditional structure-based and knowledge-driven models. Additionally, on the latest Matbench test task, Matbench-Discovery, our model outperformed the Voronoi RF model and achieved MAE results comparable to other models that rely solely on energy predictions. Our findings provide a new reference point for future LLM applications in material design, offering valuable insights for leveraging language model in this domain and emphasizing natural language descriptions over conventional model-centric design. We term this application of BERT in material design AlchemBERT, signifying its novel role in bridging natural language and structural representations.},

These are often trained based on data that present various levels of accuracy, with typically much less high- than low-fidelity data. In order to extract as much information as possible from all available data, we here introduce an approach which aims to improve the quality of the data through denoising. We investigate the possibilities that it offers in the case of the prediction of the band gap using both limited experimental data and density-functional theory relying on different exchange-correlation functionals. After analyzing the raw data thoroughly, we explore different ways to combine the data into training sequences and analyze the effect of the chosen denoiser. We also study the effect of applying the denoising procedure several times until convergence. Finally, we compare our approach with various existing methods to exploit multi-fidelity data and show that it provides an interesting improvement.},

  abstract={Traditionally, chemistry problems are solved by means of a deductive approach. The question to be addressed is typically related to the value of a property that is either measured experimentally, computed using quantum-chemistry software, or (more recently) predicted using a machine-learned model. In this paper, we demonstrate that an inductive approach can be adopted using End-to-End (E2E) machine learning. This approach is illustrated for tackling the following chemistry problems: (i) determine the fully coordinated (FC) and undercoordinated (UC) atoms in a molecule with one missing atom, (ii) identify the type of atom that is missing in such an incomplete molecule, and (iii) predict the direction of a reaction between two molecules according to an existing dataset. The E2E approach leads to accuracies higher than 99%, 98%, and 93% for these three problems, respectively. Finally, in order to achieve such accuracies, a descriptor for the molecules, called bag of clusters, is introduced and compared with a series previously proposed descriptors, highlighting a series of advantages.},

We investigate CO adsorption and dissociation on a series of Fe, Fe3C, Fe5C2, and Fe2C catalysts through density functional theory calculations. We detect dramatically different performances for CO adsorption and activation on diverse surfaces and sites. The activation of CO is dependent on the local coordination of the molecule to the surface and on the bulk phase of the underlying catalyst. The bulk properties and the different local bonding environments lead to varying interactions between the adsorbed CO and the surface and thus yielding different activation levels of the C–O bond. We also examine the prediction of CO adsorption on different types of Fe-based catalysts by machine learning through linear regression models. We combine the features originating from surfaces and bulk phases to enhance the prediction of the activation energies and perform eight different linear regressions utilizing the feature engineering of polynomial representations. Among them, a ridge linear regression model with 2nd-degree polynomial feature generation predicted the best CO activation energy with a mean absolute error of 0.269 eV.},
